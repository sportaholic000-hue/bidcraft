# BidCraft

**AI-powered RFP proposal generator for small federal contractors.**

Win more government contracts in 30 minutes — not 40 hours.

## What is BidCraft?

BidCraft turns any federal RFP into a compliant, professional proposal draft. Small contractors upload the solicitation, answer 5 questions about their company, and get a complete first draft — Executive Summary, Technical Approach, Management Plan, Past Performance, and compliance matrix — in under 30 minutes.

## The Problem We Solve

- Small contractors spend 40-80 hours per proposal
- Professional proposal writers cost $5,000-$20,000 per bid
- Most small contractors submit only 2-4 bids per year at 10-15% win rates
- Bigger firms win on paperwork, not capability

## The Solution

- First draft in under 30 minutes
- FAR/DFARS-aware proposal generation
- Auto-generated compliance matrix
- Past performance library saved and reused
- SAM.gov opportunity alerts
- Export to Word or PDF
